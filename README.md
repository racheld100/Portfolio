# Portfolio

Our assignment was to create a portfolio that gives our contact information and our projects for future potential employers to view.  
This page should be easy to edit in the future with newer/better projects to showcase our skills.

## The Header
* My name is displayed with all caps, large font, and a bright background so that the user's eye is drawn to that first.
* A navigation bar is included with working links to my About Me, Work, and Contact sections when clicked.  Each button also changes color upon hovering. 

## Body
* I created the entire body in a grid so that the section titles are parallel to the section contents.
* The first section is a brief couple of paragraphs about me and my background.
* The second section is for my work, which includes a second grid to lay out my projects.  I have included one project to start with the intent on adding more in the future.  
* The first work is larger than the others so it stands out.  I included two buttons that link to my project page and my GitHub code.
* Each work within this section "glows" (via the shadow) upon hovering for emphasis.
* The last section is the footer with my contact information.  2 of the 4 pieces of information, the LinkedIn option and GitHub option, are working links that will open in a new tab.

## Formatting/Style
* My entire profile uses a neutral color scheme of white, green, and shades of yellow, which are found as variables at the top of my CSS
* When changing browser sizes, my page has a responsive layout where some of the options/buttons stack for smaller screens
* The entire page is simple enough to read, easy to navigate, and has emphasis on the important objects.
